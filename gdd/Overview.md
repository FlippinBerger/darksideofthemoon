# Game Name
Dark Side of the Moon

# Genre
2D run n gun platformer

# Game Elements
Difficult platforming and enemies on screen that need to be shot. The game will constantly evolve on the "dark side" of the planet that you're currently on adding challenges that come your way fast and hard.

# Number of Players
1 player for now. Might be able to add some co-op

## Technical Form
2D graphics because that's easier for solo dev aka me

## View
Standard platformer but the world might need to look curved in a way to give the impression that you're moving along the curve of the current planet. Could also just make it standard side scroller for the flat earthers and it just goes until you complete the mission at hand. But I think it'd add to the illusion of the game to give the player a concept of working your way around the planet.

## Platform
Mac, PC

## Language
Rust

# GAME PLAY
Use the game play section to create a descriptive paragraph about how the game is played. You want the user to imagine
they are actually playing the game.

## DESIGN DOCUMENT
This document describes how GameObjects behave, how they’re controlled and their properties. This is often referred to as
the “mechanics” of the game. This documentation is primarily concerned with
the game itself. This part of the document is meant to be modular, meaning you could have
several different Game Design Documents attached to the Concept Document.

TODO

## Design Guidelines
This is an important statement about any creative restrictions that need to be considered and includes brief statements
about the general (i.e., overall) goal of the design.

TODO

## Game Design Definitions
This section established the definition of the game play. Definitions should include how a player wins, loses, transitions
between levels, and the main focus of the gameplay.

TODO

## Game Flowchart
The game flowchart provides a visual of how the different game elements and their properties interact. Game flowcharts
should represent Objects, Properties, and Actions present in the game. Each of these items should have a number reference
to where they exist within the game mechanics document.
• Menu
• Synopsis
• Game Play
• Player Control
• Game Over (Winning and Losing

## Player Definition
● Use this section for quick descriptions that define the player
● Use the Player Properties section (below) to define the properties for each player. Player Properties can be
affected by the player’s action or interaction with other game elements. Define the properties and how they affect
the player’s current game.
● Use the Player Rewards section to make a list of all objects that affect the player in a positive way. Define these
objects by describing what affect they cause and how the player can use the object.

## Player Definitions
A suggested list may include:
• Health
• Weapons
• Actions

## Player Properties
Each property should mention a feedback as a result of the property changing.
Player Rewards (power-ups and pick-ups)
Make a list of all objects that affect the player in a positive way (e.g., health replenished)
User Interface (UI)
This is where you’ll include a description of the user’s control of the game. Think about which buttons on a device would be
best suited for the game. Consider what the worst layout is, then ask yourself if your UI is it still playable. A visual
representation can be added where you relate the physical controls to the actions in the game. When designing the UI, it may
be valuable to research quality control and user interface (UI) design information.
